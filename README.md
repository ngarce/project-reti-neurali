# project-reti-neurali
## Final project for MSc course "Neural Networks" at University of Turin

The project has two main goals:
1. Create a feed-forward neural network from scratch (using only the numpy library).
2. Use it to forecast NBA players' salaries, trying to reach a better performance than simpler methods (linear regression).

A more detailed report can be found in the "Project report.pdf".
